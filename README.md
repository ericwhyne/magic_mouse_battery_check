# Magic Mouse Low Battery Alert

## What
This script is designed to be placed in a daily crontab and alerts with a popup if the magic mouse battery falls below 25%. 

## Why
OSX notifications are too noisy for me see mouse battery warnings. The mouse can't be used while plugged in so a dead mouse battery is disruptive.
